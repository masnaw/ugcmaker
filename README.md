UGC Video Maker is a local-first web application for generating affiliate-style UGC videos with the Google AI Studio API (Gemini, Veo). It is designed for creators, affiliate teams, and product marketers who need a simple workflow: upload product references, choose a creator/background reference, write a short script, and generate a ready-to-review video.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- SQLite via `better-sqlite3`
- Multer for image uploads
- Sharp for reference-image preprocessing
- Vanilla JavaScript and CSS

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- Google AI Studio API key

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Open the local app:

```txt
http://localhost:3000
```

For development with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

Open the Settings page inside the app and configure:

- Google AI Studio API key
- API base URL
- Default model
- Default resolution
- Default aspect ratio

Default API base URL:

```txt
https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta
```

The API key is stored in the local SQLite database. Do not commit the database file to a public repository.

## Project Structure

├── server.js            # Express app entry point
├── routes/              # Page and API routes

└── data/                # Local SQLite database
```

## Local Data

This project is intended to run locally. Uploaded assets, generated videos, thumbnails, and the SQLite database are stored on the same machine:

- `uploads/`
- `downloads/`
- `data/ugc.db`

These directories may contain private user images, generated videos, and API configuration, so they are ignored by Git.

## Notes

- Keep generated media and API credentials private when sharing the project.
- Use product images with clear lighting and minimal clutter for more consistent results.
- Review model usage and pricing in the Google AI Studio console before running large batches.
